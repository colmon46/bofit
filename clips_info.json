This will be your starting position.\nDescend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor.\nOnce you reach your bottom position, powerfully push through your heels to jump upwards, making sure to keep your arms fully extended by your side.\nOnce you land (land on the balls of your feet), you've completed one repetition.

        "short_description": "The bent-arm dumbbell pull-over was a staple exercise of the \"Golden Era\" of bodybuilding and a favorite of Arnold Schwarzenegger himself. Done properly, the exercise targets the pecs, lats, and serratus anterior muscles. Old-school bodybuilders would perform them with light weights for sets of 20 between sets of heavy 20-rep squats, but pull-overs are more popular today in moderate rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body workout.",

        "instructions": "Place a dumbbell standing up on a flat bench.\nEnsuring that the dumbbell stays securely placed at the top of the bench, lie perpendicular to the bench (torso across it as in forming a cross) with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Hips should be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well.\nGrasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest with a bend in your arms. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position. Caution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.\nWhile keeping your arms locked in the bent arm position, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.\nAt that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.\nHold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.\n\nCaution: If you are new to this movement, have a spotter hand you the weight instead. If not, please ensure that the dumbbell does not fall on you as you arrange your torso to perform the exercise on the bench.\nAlso, as I already mentioned, ensure that the dumbbell used is in perfect working condition. Old dumbbells in need of welding should never be used to perform this exercise.\nVariations:\n\nYou can perform this exercise using a barbell or an e-z bar instead of dumbbells.\nAlso, if using dumbbells like Powerblocksâ„¢, just use a dumbbell on each hand with the palms of your hands facing each other.",

For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it using both arms at the same time. Additionally, you may perform it with a starting position in which both palms are facing forward.

Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended.\nPlace the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet.\nYour back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted.\nKeep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.\n\nPhase 2: First Pull Phase\n\nLift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle. Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings.\nKeep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar.\nAs the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.\n\nPhase 3: Transition or Scoop Phase\n\nAs the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar.\nKeep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.\n\nPhase 4: Second Pull Phase\n\nInhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.\nKeep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible.\nWhen your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement.\nAs the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar.\nContinue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.\n\nPhase 5: Catch Phase\n\nAfter the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar.\nSimultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position.\nOnce the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles.\nCatch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement.\nStand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\n\nPhase 6: Downward Movement Phase\n\nLower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\nSimultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs.\nSquat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor.\nStart over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.\nWhile pushing the small of your back down in the floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off the floor.\nContinue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.\nAfter the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: There are many variations for the crunch. You can perform the exercise with weights, or on top of an exercise ball or on a decline bench.",

        "short_description": "The close-stance dumbbell front squat is a popular exercise for targeting the muscles of the lower body, the quadriceps in particular. Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.",

Hold a dumbbell (hand on each end) at chest level, with your elbows tucked inwards to your side. Keep your neck neutral and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.\nDescend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nOnce you reach your bottom position, begin to push through your heels to ascend upwards and return to the starting position.\nRepeat for recommended number of repetitions.",

This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.\nStart bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back.\nSlowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed without a hyperextension bench, but in this case you will need a spotter. Also, a similar exercise to this one is the good morning and the stiff-legged deadlift.",

For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one.\nYou can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.",

        "name": "Standing barbell calf raise",
        "short_description": "The standing barbell calf raise is a popular exercise to target the calf muscles of the lower leg, particularly the gastrocnemius muscle. It can be performed for time or for reps, either using a barbell or Smith machine bar if balance is a problem.",
        "benefits": "Stretches and targets the calf muscles to add size and strength\nAlter tempo or add pauses to increase intensity\nCan be performed with both legs at once, one leg at a time, or alternating\nUsing weight allows tracking and periodization of training",
        "type": "Strength",
        "main_muscle_worked": "Calves",
        "equipment": "Barbell",
        "level": "Beginner",
        "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the bar on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position. Tip: For better range of motion you may also place the ball of your feet on a wooden block but be careful as this option requires more balance and a sturdy block.\nRaise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\nGo back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.\nVariations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A calf press machine instead of a squat rack can be used as well as dumbbells with one leg or two legs at a time. A smith machine can be used for calf raises as well. You can also perform the barbell calf raise using a piece of wood to place the ball of the foot. This will allow you to get a better range of motion. However be cautious as in this case you will need to balance yourself much better.",

Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves.

This will be your starting position.\nInitiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels.\nDrive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise.\nWhen your hips cannot perform any further backward movement, pause, and then slowly return to the starting position by extending the hips.",

        "main_muscle_worked": "Quadriceps",
        "equipment": "Barbell",
        "level": "Expert",
        "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\nVariations:\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (Note: For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs. This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria. The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other. If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform.\nFinally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.",

The Smith machine mimics a barbell but provides more stability. This movement can be programmed like a traditional stiff-legged or Romanian deadlift, in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance. It is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a full-body or lower-body workout.",
        "benefits": "Adds size and strength to the hamstrings and glutes\nWorks the upper back, lower back, and core to maintain a neutral back position\nAllows you to press your hips back and emphasize the stretch\nThe bar moves on a track making it easier to get into position and control",

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grasp the bar using a pronated (palms forward) grip that is shoulder width apart. You may need some wrist wraps if using a significant amount of weight.\nLift the bar up by fully extending your arms while keeping your back straight. Stand with your torso straight and your legs spaced using a shoulder width or narrower stance. The knees should be slightly bent. This is your starting position.\nKeeping the knees stationary, lower the barbell to over the top of your feet by bending at the waist while keeping your back straight. Keep moving forward as if you were going to pick something from the floor until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings. Exhale as you perform this movement\nStart bringing your torso up straight again as soon as you feel the hamstrings stretch by extending your hips and waist until you are back at the starting position. Inhale as you perform this movement.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise that is recommended for people with lower back problems. Also, it needs to be treated with the utmost respect paying special attention not to round the back forward as you move the torso down; the back should always be straight. Finally, jerking motions or doing too much weight can injure your back.\nVariations: The exercise can also be performed with dumbbells or a straight bar.\nLike the Stiff-Legged Deadlift but with a Smith Machine.",

The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position.\nKeeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.\nGo back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations:\n\nYou can perform this exercise standing as well but this puts strain on your back especially if you are using heavy dumbbells like 95 lbs or so.\nAnother variation is to use an EZ or straight bar instead in which case you will be holding the bar from the inside (around 5 inches between both hands) with the palms facing forward (pronated grip).\nThere is also a bar that has parallel bars inside (often referred to as a triceps blaster) and this can also be used for this exercise.\nFinally, a low pulley cable with a rope attachment or bar (straight or EZ) attachment at the end can be used for variety purposes as well.",

Inhale as you go down and stop when your upper and lower legs almost create a 90-degree angle. Hold the stretch position for a second.\nAfter your one second hold, use your thigh muscles to bring your torso back up to the starting position. Exhale as you move up.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of times.\n\nCaution: This exercise is to be avoided if you suffer from knee problems as it can stress the knee. Also, make sure that there is nothing behind you; as in the case that you lose your balance and fall, that way nothing will hit you on the head causing an injury.\nVariations: If you are new to this exercise, you can start by using two arms (so you'll need the two beams of the squat rack in front of you to hold yourself). As you become more advanced then just use one arm. Once that becomes easy, you can use the opposite arm to hold a plate on top of your chest.",

Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells, in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other.",

Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position.\nAs you contract the triceps, move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement.

Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times.\nSqueeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position.\nSlowly return the handle to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the other arm.\n\nVariations: You can use exercise bands to perform this exercise.",

These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\nGrab the pull-down bar with the palms facing your torso (a supinated grip). Make sure that the hands are placed closer than the shoulder width.\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\nAs you breathe out, pull the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the fully contracted position and keep the elbows close to your body. The upper torso should remain stationary as your bring the bar to you and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\nAfter a second on the contracted position, while breathing in, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",

Tip: Your torso and your arms should resemble the letter \"T\". Now you are ready to begin the exercise.\nWhile keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the torso, pull the barbell up towards your upper chest as you squeeze the rear delts and you breathe out. Tip: When performed correctly, this exercise should resemble a bench press in reverse. Also, refrain from using your biceps to do the work. Focus on targeting the rear delts; the arms should only act as hooks.\nSlowly go back to the initial position as you breathe in.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise using a smith machine or a T-bar row. You can also use the low pulley as long as you use a wide grip bar attachment.",

        "equipment": "Dumbbell",
        "level": "Intermediate",
        "instructions": "Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.\nStep forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground.\nUsing mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.\nRepeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.\n\nCaution: This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues.\nVariations: There are several ways to perform the exercise.\nOne way is to alternate each leg. For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on.\nThe other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same.\nA more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.\nLunges can be performed with dumbbells as described above or with a barbell on the back, though the barbell variety is better suited for the advanced athletes who have mastered the exercise and no longer have balance issues.",

However, being able to press a significant weight overhead remains a popular marker of upper-body strength. The military press can be trained as a strength lift or in traditional muscle-building rep ranges as part of full-body, shoulder-focused, or upper-body training.",

Make sure to grip the bar wider than shoulder width apart from each other.\nSlightly bend the knees and place the barbell on your collar bone. Lift the barbell up keeping it lying on your chest. Take a step back and position your feet shoulder width apart from each other.\nOnce you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.\nLower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.\nLift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations:\n\nThis exercise can also be performed sitting as those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.\nThe behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.\nAnother option is to use dumbbells when performing this exercise for better isolation.",

Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position.\nLower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.\nLift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations:\n\nThis exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety.\nThe behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.",

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grasp the bar using a pronated (palms forward) grip that is shoulder width apart. You may need some wrist wraps if using a significant amount of weight.\nLift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. There should be a slight bend at the elbows. This is the starting position.\nUse your side shoulders to lift the bar as you exhale. The bar should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the bar, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\nLower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using a barbell, E-Z bar, straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using dumbbells, though this later exercise should be reserved by the most advanced people that are well familiarized with correct execution.\nSame as the Upright Barbell Row but with a Smith Machine.",

This is your starting position.\nWhile keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.\nSlowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\nThis exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\nAlso, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.\nBe cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n\nVariations: You can perform the same exercise using a pronated (palms facing out) grip or using dumbbells.",

As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.",

It is often used in combination with other flyes to target the chest from different angles.",
        "benefits": "Unlike dumbbells, cables provide constant tension, including at peak contraction\nCan quickly switch weights for dropsets\nThe line of resistance from the cables targets the muscles of the upper pectorals\nStretches the chest muscles under load which can lead to greater muscle gain",

This will be your starting position.\nWith a slight bend of your elbows (in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon), lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary. The movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.\nReturn your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and exhale. Hold the contracted position for a second. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: You can vary the angle of the bench in order to target the upper chest at slightly different angles.",

This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.",

This will be your starting position.\nWhile keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times. Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement. If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs.\nAfter a second contraction at the top, start to roll the barbell back forward to the starting position slowly as you inhale.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is a challenging exercise for people with healthy backs.\nVariation: This is an exercise that, just like the push-up, can also be done on the knees for less advanced athletes.",

Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second or so.\nGo back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough in your hands by holding your weight and also learning how to balance yourself so that you avoid swinging your torso. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell in between your feet. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise as if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using a vertical bench that makes the exercise easier by supporting your upper back in place and by allowing you to hold yourself by placing your elbows and arms on the side pads.",

Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up).\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution:\n\nIf you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\nAlso, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your lower chest and nowhere else.\nDon't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.\n\nVariations: You can also use dumbbells or exercise bands to perform this exercise.",

Your arms should be extended with a slight bend at the elbows and your back should be straight. This will be your starting position.\nUse your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be close to the body as you move it up and the elbows should drive the motion. Continue to lift them until they nearly touch your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbells, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\nLower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar.",

Otherwise, keep it resting to the side.\nAs you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.\nSwitch arms and repeat the movement.\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrist so that you can place the dumbbell on top of your thigh. When the dumbbell is touching your thigh simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbell on your thigh) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbell on top of the thigh).

The palm of your hands should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar.\nWith the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold the E-Z Curl Bar at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.\nAs you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.\nAs you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height. Squeeze the biceps hard and hold this position for a second.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise also using a low pulley with an E-Z Bar attachment instead. In this case you will need to position the bench in front of the pulley. You may also use a wider grip for variety purposes.",

It's a staple strength-training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper-body training days. Hold on to a post for balance, or do it free-standing to challenge core strength and stability. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per side, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.",

Lean towards your lifting arm and away from the hand that is gripping the incline bench as this will allow you to keep your balance.\nStand with a straight torso and have the dumbbell by your side at armâ€™s length with the palm of the hand facing you. This will be your starting position.\nWhile maintaining the torso stationary (no swinging), lift the dumbbell to your side with a slight bend on the elbow and your hand slightly tilted forward as if pouring water in a glass. Continue to go up until you arm is parallel to the floor. Exhale as you execute this movement and pause for a second at the top.\nLower the dumbbell back down slowly to the starting position as you inhale.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\nSwitch arms and repeat the exercise.\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed sitting down.",

        "instructions": "Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\nPull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\nAfter a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations:\n\nIf you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.\nOn the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.\nThe behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.",

Your arms should be fully extended.\nThe legs will be extended forward on top of the other bench. Your legs should be parallel to the floor while your torso is to be perpendicular to the floor. Have your partner place the dumbbell on your lap. Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance. This will be your starting position.\nSlowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.\nUsing your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging. It is best to attempt this exercise without any weights at first in order to get used to the movements required for good form. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement.",

On many machines, you can adjust the resistance level to make the movement more difficult for all four limbs. The elliptical is a mainstay in most commercial gyms, and can be equally effective for HIIT-style interval workouts or for longer-duration endurance work.",

Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.\nThe handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.\n\nEllipticals offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have far less impact on joints than ground-based cardio such as running. A 150 lb person will burn on average 387 calories in 30 minutes, compared to more than 450-700 calories running. Itâ€™s recommended that you use the arms on the elliptical to create more movement, if your elliptical has them.",

In this approach, they are usually performed in numerous sets of 3-5 reps with adequate rest in between. Speed squats are also sometimes performed with bands or chains adding extra resistance to the top half of the lift.",

        "equipment": "Barbell",
        "level": "Intermediate",
        "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Note: You should perform these exercises as fast as possible but without breaking perfect form and without involving momentum.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly due to the speed that it requires. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.",

The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.\nPull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms.\nLower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step.\nRepeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions.\nSwitch sides and repeat again with the other arm.\n\nVariations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell.",

Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution:\nIf you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\nAlso, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to touch your middle chest and nowhere else.\nDon't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.",

        "instructions": "For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\nUsing your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.\nSlowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of times.\n\nVariations: As mentioned at in the foot positioning section, you can use various foot positions in order to maximize stimulation of certain thigh areas. Also, you can perform the movement unilaterally (one leg at a time).",

The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. Toes should be facing forward, outwards or inwards as described at the beginning of the chapter. This will be your starting position.\nRaise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\nGo back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: If you suffer from lower back problems, a better exercise is the calf press as during a standing calf raise the back has to support the weight being lifted. Also, maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury.\nVariations: There are several other ways to perform a standing calf raise. A barbell instead of a machine can be used instead as well as dumbbells, one leg or two legs at a time. Refer to the exercise descriptions of these movements below.

        "instructions": "Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor.\nUse your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.\nWhile holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.\nSlowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm.\n\nVariations: This exercise can be performed standing with the torso bent forward and the arm in front of you. In this case, no leg support is used for the back of your arm so you will need to make extra effort to ensure no movement of the upper arm. This is a more challenging version of the exercise and is not recommended for people with lower back issues.",

It's done one arm at a time and the wrist stays neutral throughout the movement. It can be performed standing or seated. A single dumbbell press can be pursued as a strength goal, or trained in traditional muscle-building rep ranges such as 8-15 reps per set or more.",

Use your other arm to hold on to an incline bench to keep your balance.\nYour feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Now slowly lift the dumbbell up until you create a 90 degree angle with your arm. Note: Your forearm should be perpendicular to the floor. Continue to maintain a neutral grip throughout the entire exercise.\nSlowly lift the dumbbell up until your arm is fully extended. This the starting position.\nWhile inhaling lower the weight down until your arm is at a 90 degree angle again.\nFeel the contraction for a second and then lift the weight back up towards the starting position while exhaling. Remember to hold on to the incline bench and keep your feet positioned to keep balance during the exercise.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\nSwitch arms and repeat the exercise.\n\nVariation: This exercise can be performed with dumbbells in each arm as the dumbbells will help to keep you balanced. This is another great way to add variety to your routines and keep them interesting.",

It differs from a clean and push-press in that the lifter \"dips\" under the weight rather than simply using the legs to help push the weight up. Each rep of a clean and jerk is preceded by a clean at the start of each set. It can be trained in traditional strength or muscle-building rep ranges, in circuit or fat-loss training, or as part of a larger kettlebell combination or complex.",

As you do so, press the kettlebell overhead to lockout by extending the arms, using your body's momentum to move the weight.\nReceive the weight overhead by returning to a squat position underneath the weight.\nKeeping the weight overhead, return to a standing position. Lower the weight to the floor to perform the next repetition.",

The head will be off the bench as well.\n\n\nGrasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest at arms length. Both palms should be pressing against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position.\nCaution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face.\n\n\nWhile keeping your arms straight, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until you feel a stretch on the chest.\n\n\nAt that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was lowered and exhale as you perform this movement.\n\n\nHold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions.\n\n\nCaution: If you are new to this movement, have a spotter hand you the weight instead. If not, please ensure that the dumbbell does not fall on you as you arrange your torso to perform the exercise on the bench. Also, as I already mentioned, ensure that the dumbbell used is in perfect working condition. Old dumbbells in need of welding should never be used to perform this exercise.\nVariations:\n\nYou can perform this exercise using a barbell or an e-z bar instead of dumbbells.\nAlso, if using dumbbells like Powerblocksâ„¢, just use a dumbbell on each hand with the palms of your hands facing each other.",

Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lat as you hold the bar in front of you. The right arm can be kept by the waist. This is the starting position of the exercise.\nKeeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it as you rotate the wrist, so that by the time your hand is by your abdominals it is in a neutral position (palms facing the torso). Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard.\nHold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Tip: Remember to rotate the wrist as you go back to the starting position so that the palms are facing down again.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the right hand.\n\nVariations: You can perform this movement with a high pulley as well and standing up. You can also perform it doing a full rotation of the wrist. In other words, at the starting position you will have the palms of the hands facing down and at the end of the movement they will be facing up. Great movement to perform for a variety of purposes.",

Front squats can be trained as an alternative to back squats, as an accessory movement for either squats or deadlifts, or for strength and muscle on their own. Many lifters and athletes prefer them to back squats, although they can be uncomfortable and difficult to learn at first.",
        "benefits": "Adds size and strength to the quads, glutes, and hamstrings\nBuilds upper-back and core strength to stay upright\nEncourages good mobility in the hips, shoulders, ankles\nMay be more spine-friendly than back squats\nMultiple grip options: rack, crossed arms, \"zombie\" arms, or holding onto straps that are wrapped around the bar",

        "main_muscle_worked": "Quadriceps",
        "equipment": "Barbell",
        "level": "Intermediate",
        "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\nLift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.",

A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\nEnsure perfect form and never round the back as this can promote back injury.\nBe cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n\nVariations: You can perform the same exercise using a low pulley instead with a v-bar or with a barbell.

Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.\nLean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.\nWith your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.\nKeeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so.\nVariations:\nYou can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip).",

The bar should travel close to your body, and you should keep your elbows out.\nAt maximum elevation, your feet should clear the floor and you should start to pull yourself under the bar. The mechanics of this could change slightly, depending on the weight used. You should descend into a squatting position as you pull yourself under the bar.\nAs the bar hits terminal height, rotate your elbows around and under the bar.

This will be your starting position.\nUse your side shoulders to lift the cable bar as you exhale. The bar should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until it nearly touches your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the bar, your elbows should always be higher than your forearms. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\nLower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight or e-z bar. Another variation is to use dumbbells, though this later exercise should be reserved by the most advanced people that are well familiarized with correct execution.",

Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\nGo back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very cautious as you place the feet in the bottom part of the platform as if you slip and the safety bars are not locked then you could suffer a serious accident.\nVariations: You can perform this exercise one leg at a time.",

The clean and jerk hits every muscle from head to toe and can be the centerpiece of a lifting program. It is also popular in CrossFit and athletic training programs. It is usually performed in low rep ranges, focusing on power and movement quality.",

        "instructions": "With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.\nBegin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\nNext comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\nAs full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\nImmediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\nThe second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\nDrive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\nAt this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.",

This is your starting position.\nNow, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause.\nThen inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\nAlso, just like with the bent knee dead-lift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.\nBe cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\nVariations: You can perform the same exercise using a supinated (palms facing you) grip.",

This will be your starting position.\nAs you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that as opposed to a regular bench press, you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement.\nAfter a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall around the area between the sternum and upper abs.\nVariation: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells.",

It is popular among elite bodybuilders and physique athletes, but some coaches consider it unsafe to the shoulder joint, particularly for people with existing shoulder problems.",
        "benefits": "Targets the rhomboids and lower trapezius, two important postural muscles\nCan help build or preserve shoulder mobility, if you have adequate mobility to perform the movement\nCable provides constant tension throughout the movement, including at peak contraction\nCan be done light for high reps or in traditional muscle-building rep ranges (8-15)",

        "instructions": "Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\nGrab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso and head forward. Think of an imaginary line from the center of the bar down to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.\nAs you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches the back of your neck by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\nAfter a second on the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Performing this exercise can be hard on the rotator cuffs and if not properly executed can cause an injury to occur. Also, if you already have rotator cuff issues, I advise you to stick to the front pull-down version.\nVariations: You can also performing this exercise by bring the bar down and touching your chest. This variation is safer and not as hard on the rotator cuffs.",

Align the toes forward, inward or outward, depending on the area you wish to target, and straighten the knees without locking them. This will be your starting position.\nRaise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\nGo back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: If you don't have a machine available but have access to a calf block and a sturdy object to hold on to, you can perform this using as resistance a person sitting on your lower back (around the tailbone area).",

For example, if you have your right hand besides your head, then you want to elevate your body upwards until your right elbow touches your left knee. The same variation can be applied doing the inverse and using your left elbow to touch your right knee.\nAfter your knee touches your elbow, lower your body until you have reached the starting position.\nRemember to breathe in during the eccentric (lowering) part of the exercise and to breathe out during the concentric (upward) part of the exercise.\nContinue alternating in this manner until all of the recommended repetitions for each side have been completed.\n\nNote: While you cannot add resistance to this exercise you can concentrate on perfect execution and slow speed.",

The level of resistance can be changed throughout the workout. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.\n\nStationary bikes offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have less impact than other activities.

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, grab the bar using a pronated grip (palms facing you) shoulder width apart from each other.\nLift the barbell up and fully extend your arms with your back straight. This is the starting position.\nWhile exhaling, elevate the bar by raising your shoulders until they come close to touching your ears.\nHold the contraction for a second before lowering the bar back down to the starting position while inhaling.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations:\n\nThis exercise can be performed using a squat rack with a barbell. However, be careful not to select a weight that is so heavy that it causes you to break good form as you do not have the support of the smith machine for this variation. Too much weight can harm your back.\nYou can also use dumbbells to perform this exercise.",

Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter as this exercise can be a bit challenging. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\nSame as the Barbell Incline Bench Press but with a Smith Machine.",

        "short_description": "The barbell thruster is a full-body exercise that incorporates both squatting and pressing in one functional movement. It's especially common in contemporary CrossFit workouts, but also in general strength training. The barbell is usually cleaned into place first, but it could be performed taken from a squat rack in a front-rack position. The thruster can be performed in traditional strength-focused rep ranges to build strength in the press, or in higher reps for full-body conditioning.",
        "benefits": "Front squat develops quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core strength\nOverhead press works shoulders, triceps, and upper back\nCan be a strength move or a metcon, depending on rep range\nSquat helps push through the sticking point of the press",

Rest the bar on top of the front deltoids, pushing into the clavicles, and lightly touching the throat. Your hands should be in a clean grip, touching the bar only with your fingers to help keep it in position.\nTo unrack the bar, push upward into it and push your hips forward. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. Your triceps should remain parallel with the ground. Keep a neutral neck and flat back. This will be your starting position.\nDescend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt back. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nAs you prepare to ascend, push through your heels and begin to wrap your fingers tightly around the bar for a firm grip. As you near the top of your squat, begin pressing the bar up towards the ceiling, allowing your neck to hyperextend so that the bar has room to move.\nA final position will be one in which your arms are fully extended overhead and your legs straight. Maintain tightness from head to toe.\nLower the bar slowly, allowing your knees to bend to lessen the blow. Immediately transition back into the squatting movement to continue into the next repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.",

If this movement hurts your knees, try performing split squats instead.",

        "instructions": "Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position.\nStep backward with your right leg around two feet or so from the left foot and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Tip: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. Keep the torso upright during the lunge; flexible hip flexors are important. A long lunge emphasizes the Gluteus Maximus; a short lunge emphasizes Quadriceps.\nPush up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Tip: Use the ball of your feet to push in order to accentuate the quadriceps. To focus on the glutes, press with your heels.\nNow repeat with the opposite leg.\n\nVariations: There are several ways to perform the exercise. You can do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same. A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.\nLunges can be performed with dumbbells as described above or with a barbell on the back, though the barbell variety is better suited for the advanced athletes who have mastered the exercise and no longer have balance issues.",

At the end of this step your arms should be overhead and perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: Keep your elbows in at all times.\nAs you inhale, lower the bar by bending at the elbows and while keeping the upper arm stationary. Keep lowering the bar until your forearms are perpendicular to the floor.\nAs you exhale bring the bar back up to the starting position by pushing the bar up in a semi-circular motion until the lower arms are also parallel to the floor. Contract the triceps hard at the top of the movement for a second. Tip: Again, only the forearms should move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariation: You can use dumbbells to make the exercise more challenging.",

This will be your starting position.\nSlowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down.\nUsing your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: You can place your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you in order to make the exercise more challenging. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement.",

Also, dumbbells can be used. Beginners can start with only the bodyweight, especially if they have balance issues.",

The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position.\nUsing the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.\nAfter a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises.\nJust like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment.",

Tip: There should be a 90-degree angle between the forearms and the upper arm. This is your starting position.\nKeeping the upper arms stationary, use the triceps to lift the weights as you exhale until the forearms are parallel to the floor and the whole arms are extended. Like many other arm exercises, only the forearm moves.\nAfter a second contraction at the top, slowly lower the dumbbells back to their starting position as you inhale.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations:\n\nThis exercise can be executed also one arm at a time.\nAlso, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a single hand handle or rope attachment instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case of the single hand handle, the palms should be facing up as opposed to the torso.",

The hip and torso motion are similar to a kettlebell swing, as are the muscles it targets, including the hamstrings, glutes, upper back, and grip. However, unlike the traditional kettlebell swing, the arms are outside of the knees.

        "instructions": "Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\nGrab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\nAs you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\nAfter a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.",

Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly in order to better engage the lats. This will be your starting position.\nUsing your lats, pull your torso up while leaning your head back slightly so that you do not hit yourself with the chin-up bar.

These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.\n\nOn the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.",

        "instructions": "To begin, first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward), unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nPosition your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with leg presses instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\nSame as the Barbell Squat but with a Smith Machine.",

This will be your starting position.\nUse your side shoulders to lift the dumbbell as you exhale. The dumbbell should be close to the body as you move it up. Continue to lift it until the dumbbell is nearly in line with your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbell, your elbow should always be higher than your forearm. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\nLower the dumbbell back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and switch arms.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from upright rows and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar, cables and exercise band.",

Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.\nTreadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside. A 150 lb person will burn over 450 calories running 8 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Maintain proper posture as you run, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.",

This movement can be programmed in low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle and strength endurance.

        "instructions": "Place a flat bench underneath the smith machine. Now place the barbell at a height that you can reach when lying down and your arms are almost fully extended. Once the weight you need is selected, lie down on the flat bench. Using a pronated grip that is wider than shoulder width, unlock the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\nAs you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest.\nAfter a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nWhen you are done, lock the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\nSame as the Barbell Bench Press but with a Smith Machine.",

Many lifters find they can handle more weight going wide than with narrower grips, although it's also worth noting that plenty of banged-up lifters have said benching with a wide grip may also have contributed to their shoulder injuries and pain. The wide-grip bench is often used as a chest-building movement in chest or upper-body workouts, or as an accessory movement for the traditional bench press.",

The bar will be perpendicular to the torso and the floor. This will be your starting position.\nAs you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest.\nAfter a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\nIf you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used.\nAlso, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else.\nDon't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in full control of the barbell at all times.\n\nVariations: You can use dumbbells for this exercise as well as exercise bands.\nSame as the Barbell Bench Press but with a different grip.",

        "equipment": "Barbell",
        "level": "Intermediate",
        "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. The correct height should be anywhere above the waist but below the chest. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, lock your hands together and place the bar on top of your arms in between the forearm and upper arm.\nLift the bar up so that it is resting on top of your forearms. If you are holding the bar properly, it should look as if you have your arms crossed but with a bar running across them.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\nBegin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the ball of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This exercise is not to be taken lightly as you are applying a lot of pressure to your arms when lifting the barbell. It is always a good idea to have a spotter as they can help you keep proper form. Also, make sure that your back is kept straight as bending it can cause an injury.",

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and step forward with your right leg and squat down through your hips, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: Do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. li>\nUsing mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.\nRepeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.\n\nCaution: This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues.\nVariations: There are several ways to perform the exercise.\n\nOne way is to alternate each leg. For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on.\nThe other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same.\nA more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.",

It is similar to the seated leg curl, but the open hip angle in the lying leg curl may incorporate more glute and calf activation. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of a leg pre-exhaust or as a muscle-building movement for lower-body training.",

        "instructions": "Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.\nKeeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.\nAs you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.\nAs you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring injury.\nVariations: Since you have three foot positions you have in reality three exercises. The movement can also be performed with a dumbbell held in between your feet (a partner needs to place it properly). This latter exercise though is only suitable for advanced trainees. Finally, it is also possible to just use one leg at a time for better isolation.",

Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up.\nNow grasp the barbell using an overhand (pronated) grip and unlock it from the smith machine rack. Then let it hang directly in front of you as your arms hang extended perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position.\nWhile keeping the torso stationary, lift the barbell as you breathe out, keeping the elbows close to the body and not doing any force with the forearm other than holding the weights. On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second.\nSlowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution:\n\nThis exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues.\nAlso, just like with the bent knee deadlift, if you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury.\nBe cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\n\nVariations: You can perform the same exercise using a supinated (palms facing you) grip. You can also use barbells and dumbbells.\nSimilar to the Barbell Bent Over Row but with a Smith Machine bar instead.",

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wider for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings, or closer together for more quad development. Keep your head facing forward.\nWith your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Pause when you reach the box, and relax the hip flexors. Never bounce off of a box.\nKeeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward off of the box as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe.",

        "short_description": "The dumbbell bench press is a mainstay of workout enthusiasts worldwide. It’s a classic move for building a bigger, stronger chest. As such, it’s often placed first in mass-building chest workouts.",
        "benefits": "Builds bigger pectorals\nAlso works the triceps and deltoids, particularly the front heads\nOne side can’t compensate for the other, as in the barbell bench press",

        "equipment": "Dumbbell",
        "level": "Intermediate",
        "instructions": "Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other.\nThen, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.\nOnce at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.\nThen, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.\nVariations:\nAnother variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other.\nAlso, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.",

This will be your starting position.\nStart pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs.\nAs the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion.\nLift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible.\nNow in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position.\nFinalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.\n\nCaution: This is a very advanced exercise so be extremely careful with the weight used. Bad form on this exercise can lead to serious injury.",

        "short_description": "The Smith machine pistol squat is a machine-based exercise that targets the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It is similar in form to a pistol squat but is performed with a bar on the shoulders. This adds extra resistance, but also eliminates some of the balance challenge of single-leg squats. This squat variation can be performed in low reps for strength or for higher reps for muscle gain.",

Step under it and position the bar across the back of your shoulders.\nTake the bar with your hands facing forward, unlock it and lift it off the rack by extending your legs.3\nMove one foot forward about 12 inches in front of the bar. Extend the other leg out in front of you, holding it off the ground. Look forward at all times and maintain a neutral or slightly arched spine. This will be your starting position.\nMaintaining good posture, lower yourself by flexing the knee and hip, going down as far as flexibility allows.\nPause briefly at the bottom and then return to the starting position by driving through the heel of your foot, extending the knee and hip.",

When walking, you should move at a moderate to fast pace, not a leisurely one.

        "level": "Beginner",
        "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set a flat bench behind you and set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\nLift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.",

This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms.\nStart bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat.

By using dumbbells you will be able to isolate your chest and add some variety to your workouts.\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the barbell or dumbbell next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. A better way to do this is to use both of your hands to grab the barbell or dumbbell and place it to your side. Simply move the barbell or dumbbell away from the arm you are exercising before dropping the weights. This will ensure optimal safety and prevent any injuries.",

        "instructions": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place it on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance. Also maintain a straight back and keep the knees with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position.\nRaise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending (other than the slight initial bend we created during positioning) at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.\nGo back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.\nNow lift your toes by contracting the tibia muscles in the front of the calves as you breathe out.\nHold for a second and bring them back down as you breathe in.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Maintain your back straight and stationary at all times. Rounding of the back can cause lower back injury. Also, choose a conservative weight. This exercise requires a lot of balance and choosing too much weight may cause you to lose balance and fall.\nVariations: A smith machine can be used for this exercise as well and it is a better choice for those with poor balance. Dumbbells can be used also.",

This is your starting position.\nPull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\nAfter a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.\nNow repeat the same movements as described above except this time your torso will remain straight as you go up and the bar will touch the back of the neck instead of the upper chest. Tip: Use the head to lean forward slightly as it will help you properly execute this portion of the exercise.\nOnce you have lowered yourself back down to the starting position, repeat the exercise for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.\n\nCaution: The behind the neck variation can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck so this exercise is not recommended for people with shoulder problems.\nVariations:\n\nIf you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.\nOtherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.\nYou can also use a pull-down machine.",

Alternatively you can also use a chin assist machine.\nVariations: If you have developed enough strength to perform this exercise with weights, do so with caution. Side to side chins can be a challenging exercise and if not performed correctly, can cause injury. Before attempting to use weights, make sure you are able to perform the exercise with good form.\nYou can also perform the side to side chins by doing all reps to one side and then the next or by also including the middle movement as well (in which case you would pull up first to the left hand side, then the middle and then the right side).\nYou can use a chin assist machine if you do not have the strength to perform the exercise on your own.",

This will be your starting position.\nAs you breathe in, bring the bar down slowly until it is about 1 inch from your neck.\nAfter a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack.\n\nCaution:\n\nIt is advised that you use a spotter for this exercise. If no spotter is available, then be very conservative with the amount of weight used.\nAlso, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to be about 1 inch from your neck and nowhere else.\nYou should be in full control of the barbell at all times.\n\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed with the smith machine.",

At this point you will hold the contraction for a second.\nAs you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then switch to the other arm.\n\nCaution: There is no need to go heavy with this exercise. Too much weight will cause rotator cuff injury.\nVariations: You can perform this exercise standing and with cables.",

Similarly, the stance you use can affect where it hits; the closer your feet are, the more the sides will be isolated, whereas the further apart your feet are, the more the front tibialis will be targeted.",

This is your starting position.\nKeeping the upper arms stationary, slowly move the dumbbells in and down in a semi circular motion until they touch the upper chest while inhaling. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times and do not move the upper arms nor rest the dumbbells on the chest.\nAs you breathe out, move the dumbbells up using your triceps and the same semi-circular motion but in reverse. Attempt to keep the dumbbells together as they move up. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down again slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.\n\nCaution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.\nJust lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor.",

This will be your starting position. Tip: The dumbbell should be next to your thighs with the palm of your hands facing back.\nUse your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be to the side of the body as you move them up. Continue to lift it until the dumbbells are nearly in line with your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbell, your elbow should always be higher than your forearm. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.\nLower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from this movement and substitute by some form of lateral raises.\nVariations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar, cables and exercise band.",

        "level": "Beginner",
        "instructions": "Stand up straight with a flat bench behind you while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).\nPosition your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\nBegin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nCaution: Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.\nVariations: As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\nYou can also use a barbell for this exercise. Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.",

This will be your starting position.\nAs you breathe out, extend your lower arms until they are straight and vertical. The upper arms and elbows remain stationary throughout the movement.

Straddle the weight, wrapping your arms around the implement, bending at the hips.\nBegin by pulling the weight up past the knees, extending through the hips. As the weight clears the knees, it can be lapped by resting it on your thighs and sitting back, hugging it tightly to your chest.\nFinish the movement by extending through your hips and knees to raise the weight as high as possible. The weight can be returned to the lap or to the ground for successive repetitions.",

Your rear end should be close to the floor without touching it.\nWith both hands, reach back and grab the handle of each cable.\nWith your feet positioned in a wide stance, extend your arms straight out in front of you and in between your knees. Your hands should be at knee level.\nKeep your arms straight and in-line with the upward angle of the cable. Elevate your torso in a crunching motion without dropping or bending your arms.\nMaintain the rigid position with your arms. Slowly descend back to the starting position with your back arched around the Bosu Ball and your abdominals elongated.\nRepeat the same series of movements to failure.\nOnce you reach failure, keep your abs tight and raise your torso into plank position so your back is elevated off the Bosu Ball.\nLower your arms down to your side; keep them straight. Start doing alternating side bends; reach for your heels! This finishing movement will focus on your obliques.\n\nTip: Arch your back around the Bosu Ball before each rep to fully elongate your abdominals. This will provide a full range of motion and lengthen your muscle fibers, giving them a much fuller appearance.",
